This project is forked from a mutual project of Liron Blum & me. 
This project is identical to the original project we developed together 
but contains additional information (screenshots, presentation & background ) 
which will be presented by me at Reversim Summit 2018 - https://summit2018.reversim.com/session/5b0d4dfc4b330d00147e3374

Activation: 
-----------
There are detailed activation instructions in each service - Readme file.
Here I will elborate on activating and getting results from the service 'planner' 
since this is the service which activates the Genetic Algorithm. 

1. Download / clone project
2. Build & run planner container  : 
        cd planner
       /planner $ scripts/run.sh build
       /planner $ scripts/run.sh up 
3. In order to make sure you did it all correctly go to the swaggerUI at this address: 
   http://localhost:9122/docs/#/
